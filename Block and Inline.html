<!-- Every Html Element has a default display value depending upon the type of element -->
<!-- By default there are two type of display values BLock and Inline -->

<!-- A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. -->

<!-- An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. -->
